	TV Shows Mobile is the app that I designed to ease people like me watching movies at tvshows4mobile.com track down new episode and seasons 
	of their favorite tv shows. You can download it on google play store from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dahham.serieshunter">here</a><br />

			<h2 align=center>INTRODUCTION</h2>
			<font size="4">
			This Tutorial is aimed at helping people understand how the app works and also how to used it.
			Tv Shows Mobile only tracks down Shows from tvshows4mobile.com but that does not limit the user from adding shows from other sources; is just that it will not 
			provide update for such shows.
